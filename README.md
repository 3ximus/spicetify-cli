This is just a fork from spicetify with some tweaks to [Elementary](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Elementary) to have gruvbox colors

```sh
spicetify config extensions <somthing.js>  # from inside Extensions/
spicetify config current_theme GruvboxElementary color_scheme Gruvbox
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
spicetify backup apply
```
